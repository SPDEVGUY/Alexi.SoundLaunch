# Alexi.SoundLaunch
Sound launcher for Ableton Novation LaunchPad S, uses NAudio and IntelOrca.Launchpad

Wishlist for dev actions is in ActionLog.txt

Dependecy on project: https://github.com/IntelOrca/launchpad
(I'm new to github and don't know how to make it included in some way)

I also noticed I needed the driver from here:
