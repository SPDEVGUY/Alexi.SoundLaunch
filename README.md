# Alexi.SoundLaunch
Sound launcher for Ableton Novation LaunchPad S, uses NAudio and IntelOrca.Launchpad

Project goal:
- Make this Launcher S pad I got off a friend useful for playing instant sfx.
- Create a program that will import a directory of mp3 or wav files and allow me to play them with various effects by pressing buttons on the launcher.


Wishlist for dev actions is in ActionLog.txt

Dependecy on project: https://github.com/IntelOrca/launchpad
(I'm new to github and don't know how to make it included in some way)

I found the orca launchpad lacked a structured approach so the LaunchPad.cs provides way more structure and input monitoring including button-up control and duration of press which could do other nifty things.

I also noticed I needed the driver installed from here:
